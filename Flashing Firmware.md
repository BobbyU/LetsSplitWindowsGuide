1) Open up AVRDUDESS

> * If you get an error saying that it can’t start because libusb0.dll is missing then **read step 3 of the Setting Up(Flashing .hex prerequisites)** section above

2) Select **Atmel AppNote AVR109 Boot Loader** for the **programmer**

3) Select **ATmega32U4** for the **MCU**

4) Select your .hex file in the for the flash box (**click the … box to the right**)

5) Select the **`eeprom-lefthand.eep`** file in the QMK Lets_split folder for the **EEPROM box** 
(Note: For new versions of QMK use QMK\quantum\split_common)

> * Make sure to select only one file, as you will have to change this file when flashing the right side

6) Connect **only the left side** of your board to the computer through a USB cable

7) Take note of the port drop down menu and see if you have any COMM listings, if you do, then Don’t select those particular ones in the next step

8) Locate the **ground and reset** pins on your pro micro and short them, was 2 from the top on the right side of the pro micro for me

8b) Alternatively you can set the baud rate to 1200 and hit program to cause a reset but you'll need to set the baud rate back to 57600 or leave the baud rate blank to get it to program properly once you get it in bootloader mode.

9) Take something metal and touch between the **ground and reset** pins to short them out, or if your’s has a reset button then press that to enter the bootloader mode

10) Quickly open the Port drop down menu and select the new **COMM** port that has popped up, then click program

> * If the pro micro came out of bootloader mode, then you won’t be able to flash it, but all you have to do is enter bootloader mode again by shorting the pins again.

11) **Now the left side is done, we have to flash the right side**, so connect it to your PC through USB 

12) **Be sure to change the EEPROM file to the right hand one (eeprom-righthand.eep)**

13) Locate the ground and reset pins on your pro micro and short them, was 3 from the top on the right side of the pro micro for me

14) Take something metal and touch between the ground and reset pins to short them out, or if your’s has a reset button then press that to enter the bootloader mode

15) Quickly open the Port drop down menu and select the new COMM port that has popped up, then click program 

> * If the pro micro came out of bootloader mode, then you won’t be able to flash it, but all you have to do is enter bootloader mode again by shorting the pins again.

16) Time to test it out, plug in your TRRS cable to both sides, and then plug in the USB on the left side and open a notepad window to test out all the keys and make sure your soldering skills were good

17) **Congrats on correctly flashing your own Let’s Split, and hope this helps those out who are having trouble with programming their Let’s Splits like I did**
